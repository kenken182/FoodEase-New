FoodEase is a project that started out from QueenHacks of 2019! Initially, we decided to do an IoT project consisting of cameras detecting
food in refrigerators. These pictures would then identify the ingredients in the fridge, and compile a list of 
ingredients. From there, it would pull potential ingredients.

Previously, we used GCP API and Edamame API. However, for now (as of July 7, 2019), I am working on base functionality, and using tests.
I am also currently using MongoDB Atlas to track the collections easier, and also Postman for mock requests.

Note: 

If you want to pull from this repo, a few things:
1. In config of the API folder, you will need to fill in your MongoDB URI, which you can get from MongoDB Atlas.
2. Yeah, set up your mongoDB Atlas.
